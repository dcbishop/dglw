====
Dave's GL Wrapper is a C++ OpenGL Object Orientated wrapping library. It's designed for personal use and not designed to be 'complete' as I add stuff I need as I need it.

Testing
-------
The easy way to do testing with gtest under Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install gtest
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake .
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib

NOTE: No tests are currently implmented...
